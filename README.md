# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction-Project
A bicycle-sharing system is a service that allows users to rent or use bicycles that are available for shared use for a fee or for free. There are already over 500 bike-sharing schemes operating across the world. By offering free/affordable access to bicycles for short-distance rides in an urban region instead of motorised vehicles, such systems often attempt to alleviate congestion, noise, and air pollution. For such systems, the number of users on any given day can vary substantially.

# Problem Statement:
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

# Data Summary
• Date : Date on which bike was rented.

• Rented Bike count : It tells number of Bikes rented ,for a given date and for a given one hour duration

• Hour : Hour of the day for which data is given.

• Temperature : Temperature of city in Celsius for the given time duration

• Humidity - % : Humidity in the city for the given time duration

• Windspeed - m/s : Windspeed in the city for the given time duration

• Visibility - 10m: This number tells about the visibility condition of the city

• Dew point temperature – Celsius : Dew point temperature of city in Celsius for the given time duration

• Solar radiation - MJ/m2 : Tells the Solar Radiation Intensity for a given time

• Rainfall – mm: Talks about the Rainfall intensity

• Snowfall – cm: Talks about the Snowfall intensity
